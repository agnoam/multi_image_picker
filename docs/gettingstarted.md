# Getting Started

?> In order to start using multi_image_picker you must have the [Dart SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/install) installed on your machine.

## Installation

The first thing we need to do is add the multi_image_picker package to our `pubspec.yaml` as a dependency.

```yaml
dependencies:
  multi_image_picker: ^2.3.29
```

Next we need to install the plugin.

!> Make sure to run the following command from the same directory as your `pubspec.yaml` file.

- Run `flutter packages get`

## Import

Now that we have successfully installed multi_image_picker, we can create our `main.dart` and import multi_image_picker.

```dart
import 'package:multi_image_picker/multi_image_picker.dart';
```
